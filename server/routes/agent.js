/**
 * The Memory Lane voice assistant.
 *
 * Two kinds of route live here, and they are deliberately in one file because
 * they describe one thing — the companion.
 *
 *   Session  GET  /api/agent/config   how the browser should open the call
 *            POST /api/agent/token    a short-lived AssemblyAI token
 *
 *   Tools    GET  /api/agent/now      the day, the date and the time of day
 *            GET  /api/agent/context  today, what's coming, memory of the day
 *            GET  /api/agent/person   one familiar face, by name or relationship
 *            GET  /api/agent/memories search the saved memories
 *            GET  /api/agent/define   what a word means
 *            GET  /api/agent/search   the search engine, for the rest of the world
 *            POST /api/agent/remember keep a note
 *            POST /api/agent/edit-memory  correct a memory already saved
 *            POST /api/agent/today    add a reminder to today
 *            POST /api/agent/cancel   take a plan off, on any day, but keep it
 *            POST /api/agent/move     change when a plan happens, on any day
 *
 * Plans are matched against every day at once — today, the days ahead in the
 * schedule, and the "Coming up" list — because a person does not distinguish
 * between where the app happens to keep them. Cancelling never destroys
 * anything: the plan is only marked hidden, and the change is written to
 * `schedule.changes`, which a family member reads through
 * GET /api/schedule/changes (see routes/schedule.js).
 *
 * The tool routes are what the companion calls to answer a question or save
 * something. They are ordinary JSON endpoints: a client-side tool reaches them
 * from the browser on a local run, and an AssemblyAI HTTP tool reaches them
 * over the internet once the app is deployed. The API key never leaves this
 * process — the page only ever gets a single-use token.
